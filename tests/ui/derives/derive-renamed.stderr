   = help: the trait `Debug` is not implemented for `S`
   = note: add `#[derive(Debug)]` to `S` or manually `impl Debug for S`
   = note: this error originates in the macro `$crate::format_args_nl` which comes from the expansion of the macro `println` (in Nightly builds, run with -Z macro-backtrace for more info)
help: consider annotating `S` with `#[derive(Debug)]`

LL + #[derive(Debug)]
LL | struct S;
